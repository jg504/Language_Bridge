# Language_Bridge
Project Brief
Problem statement:
The best way of learning a language is by writing and speaking to a native speaker. Most language learners are unable to get this exposure. 

Proposed solution
A web app that connects a native speaker to a language learner who is trying to learn that person's language. The two users will be connected to each other based on interests.
